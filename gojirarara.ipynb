Though model accuracy is important, but in case of fake news detector, the cost of false negative of this fake news classifier (i.e. predicting a headline as genuine but it is actually a fake news) is definitely much bigger than that of a satire classifier. It is okay if our bot cannot get the jokes, but it would cause big problem if it tells people a news is trustworthy while it is fake. Therefore, for fake news classifier we should try to pull the confusion matrix and make sure it has a low false negative rate."

    "I told my friends that I built a chatbot to detect satires. I created three twitter accounts (unfortunately none of us use twitter), handed them the passwords, and let them find headlines and mention my chatbot. I did suggest them to from good ones from either the Onion or the Daily Mash and mention my chatbot to help them detect if it is a joke or not. Both sources have a good amount of satirical news.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 1:  How did what your participants input compare to the ones you tested so far? How did participants react when the chatbot didn’t respond correctly, or responded with nonsense? (2.5 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Compare user input with my input\n",
    "\n",
    "* My friends tried to find some funny headlines from the two sources I gave them, but one of them also tried to say something like \"hey what can you tell me about?\" even I told them my chatbot is not built for answering questions and their questions will be treated as a headline. \n",
    "\n",
    "I think this has to do with the mental model of users. Users have no knowledge of how the bot is built and they cannot tell what's the difference between analyzing their questions as questions and analyzing their questions as a news headline. \n",

    "\n",
    "Again, users have no knowledge of how the bot is built. They think either mentioning the bot before or after the headline should not matter, but it does. In my original design, the headline must be typed after @bot. If the headline was added before tagging the bot, it wouldn't work. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Users' reaction to my chatbot's nonsense reply\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ordinary users cannot understand what the chatbot is replying (\"is it telling me a joke?? or is it writing another headline? a satire? not a satire?\")\n",
    "* They also found that the chatbot produces nonsense words (xxbos) and cannot finish the sentence properly. They think those are the signs that the chatbot behaves poorly. Without understanding the algorithm behind, they feel that this bot is just producing random sentences.\n",
    "* They were actually quite impressed that the bot did pretty well in detecting their satires. But they felt that they have no idea what the reply means. They only noticed that the first three words of the chatbot's reply are the same as their previous input. But the rest of the sentence make little sense to them. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 2:  what change could you make in response to this feedback? (2.5 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "####  I fixed the input format issue which caused my bot to run into error. \n",
    "One of my friends accidentally swapped the order of mentioning the bot and writing the headline, so the headline looks like this: \"Magazine blahblah @bot_gojirarara\", and my bot could not give it a response properly. Therefore, in order to fix this issue, I let the chatbot check if the string before @bot_gojirarara is empty string '',  if so, my bot will store the string after @bot_gojirarara as usual, if the string before mentioning my bot is not empty string, I will store and use that non-empty string before @bot_gojirarara. (code is now modified, you can find it under comment ### revised code)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Another issue I realized is the difference between users' mental model and how the machine works in reality. \n",
    "It reminds me of the google ads—users are not sure why they see certain ads and feel annoyed if they see something that they aren't actually interested. I think in terms of our chatbot, it should: \n",
    "* Clearly tell users what it can do versus what it cannot do (such as \"it is a satire detecter, you can try telling it a joke or let it analyze a satirical headline, but unfortunately, it is not able to answer your question such as 'can you tell me a joke?'\")\n",
    "* Clearly define the format of which users should interact with it (you should start your sentence bt '@bot_gojirarara '\") and make sure users get this information to users before they can start the conversation with the bot (for the types of chatbot that lives in a little dialog box by the corner of a webpage, the format of input should be indicated on the welcome page, and users have to select 'yes, I read through it' to continue). \n",
    "* We could try to add a feature such as if users think the bot behaves strange/ want to know more about how the bot works, type '@bot_gojirarara What does your reply mean?' and explain that the bot used the first three words of the user input and tried to generate a headline. "
